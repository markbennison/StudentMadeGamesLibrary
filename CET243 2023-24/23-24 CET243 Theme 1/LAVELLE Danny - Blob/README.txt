Part of Rapid Game Prototyping module (where a game has to be made each week) the theme of this week is Advancing Wall of Doom 

Github - https://github.com/DannyLavelle/Blob-RapidPrototypingWeek1.git

Controls (developed with xbox controller should work on other controllers with their respective layouts )
Left trigger - stick to objects while held, can only stick to green blocks (you can't jump while sticking, you have to release lt ro jump, you can charge while sticking however)
right trigger - charge a jump, release rt to jump (approx 2 seconds to max charge)
Start/select - bring up pause menu 
left stick - aim your jump

notes
obstacles are infinitly generated in "blocks" there are 5-6 of them so it may take a while to see them all 
the adhearence to the theme is the rising water level
the rising water level gets slightly quicker every block you pass 
you can triple jump, each jump needs to be charged 
you can jump midair (you can drop from a surface and use all 3 jumps)
