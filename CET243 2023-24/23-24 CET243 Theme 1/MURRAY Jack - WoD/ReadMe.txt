Hey Mark, so the controls are as follows

AD = horizontal movement
W = jumping

jumping seems to be a bit finicky, for some reason it wont 
work all the time 100% consistently, however if you cant jump wall towards a wall and jump, that appears to fix the issue.
I have also messed around with the input system, but I'm not sure if it worked, I set up the action map with how the inputs interact
with the movement, but I cant test it due to not having a controller
