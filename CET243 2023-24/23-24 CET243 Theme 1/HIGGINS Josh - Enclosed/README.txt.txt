i didnt get the controller settings working so it only used a and d or
the left and right arrow keys, and space bar to jump.

The Character is able to wall slide and wall jump which helps progress through
the level.

if you die in the game to exit you will have to use the alt+f4 to close the game
as i didnt get the menus working.
