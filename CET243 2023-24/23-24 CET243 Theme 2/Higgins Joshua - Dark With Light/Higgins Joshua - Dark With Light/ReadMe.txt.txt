Josh Higgins - Dark with Light

The Controls are A and D with space bar for player 1

Player 2 is the left,right and up arrow keys.

The player that needs to stay in the light must keep moving in the light for
them to survive.

the aim of the game is to move through the level with one player only staying 
in the light and the other only staying in the dark, good luck and enjoy.
